}

// Summary of Mistakes:
// - There was a misunderstanding about protected method access from subclasses.
// - Clarification was needed for synchronized methods and their thread-safety utility.
// - The transient keyword purpose was understood, but a real-world example was provided for better comprehension.
// - The volatile keyword usage was correctly identified, emphasizing its role in thread visibility.
